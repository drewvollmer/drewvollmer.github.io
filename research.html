              <!-- <span class="italics">Abstract</span>: --> When is
              resale valuable?  And when can it be replaced with
              refunds?  I study common aftermarket policies in
              perishable goods markets with demand uncertainty.  Using
              primary and resale market data on college football
              ticket sales, I estimate a structural model comparing
              resale, which has flexible prices but incurs frictions,
              to a partial refund scheme, which is centralized but has
              rigid prices.  In the model, consumers anticipate shocks
              when making initial purchases, then engage in resale
              after shocks are realized.  Because of resale frictions,
              refunds are more efficient on average.  However,
              flexible prices make resale more efficient after large
              aggregate shocks.

              <!-- <span class="italics">Abstract</span>: --> How does
              resale affect multiproduct bundling?  I investigate using a model of
              monopoly bundling with costly resale.  Consumers purchase in the
              primary market while anticipating resale, then participate in a
              resale market with market-clearing prices.  Resale forces the
              monopolist to balance the additional profit from a discounted bundle
              against the opportunity for consumer arbitrage.  In equilibrium, the
              monopolist may still offer a discounted bundle, but resale reduces
              the returns to bundling and has an ambiguous effect on consumer and
              total welfare.  When consumers have heterogeneous costs of resale,
              it is possible for consumers to resell in equilibrium.

              <!-- <span class="italics">Abstract</span>: --> By
              offering refunds, ticket sellers can reallocate tickets
              to high-value consumers while avoiding fees paid to
              third-party resale platforms.  So why do ticket sellers
              overwhelmingly allow refunds, and why have some
              integrated with the resale market?  Using a model in
              which a capacity-constrained seller with rigid prices
              makes sales over two periods, I show that third-party
              and integrated resale outperform refunds when the
              average consumer value is uncertain.  Specifically, I
              reach three conclusions.  First, third-party resale is
              more profitable than refunds when there is significant
              aggregate uncertainty and resale fees are relatively
              low.  When there is significant aggregate uncertainty,
              the seller's primary market prices may be suboptimal.
              It benefits from resale because resale's flexible prices
              adjust to reallocate tickets from low- to high-value
              consumers.  But with little uncertainty or high fees,
              refunds can be better because they avoid paying fees to
              the resale market.  Second, integrated resale offers the
              seller complete protection from demand uncertainty.  By
              selling to brokers, the seller earns as much as if it
              could freely adjust its prices and the refund offered to
              early buyers.  Third, consumers benefit from integrated
              resale and refunds when the number of consumers buying
              in the second period increases.  The findings explain
              why ticket sellers have deepened ties with resellers and
              provide guidance on when resale is valuable and when
              sellers should prefer alternatives.
