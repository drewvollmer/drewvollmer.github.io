            <h5>(Job Market Paper)</h5>
            <p class="desc_p">
              <!-- <span class="italics">Abstract</span>: --> What are
              the profit- and welfare-maximizing sales strategies for
              a seller of perishable goods facing demand uncertainty?
              I use a structural model of college football ticket
              sales that includes primary and resale markets to
              evaluate three sales strategies: resale, partial
              refunds, and a menu of state-dependent refund contracts.
              The optimal strategy depends on the properties of demand
              uncertainty, specifically whether shocks are
              idiosyncratic or aggregate and whether changes in
              consumer values across states of the world are
              heterogeneous.  The model includes shocks with each
              property.  I estimate the model using ticket sales data
              covering nearly 40,000 primary market transactions and
              over 6,000 resale market transactions, data on 576
              annual resale prices for 76 college football teams, and
              500 survey responses on willingness to pay for football
              tickets in states with and without a covid-19 vaccine.
              The data demonstrate that consumer values change after
              shocks: over 5% of all tickets are resold and resale
              prices often deviate by more than 25% from the average.
              Moreover, consumers have heterogeneous reactions to the
              state with no vaccine: almost a third report the same
              willingness to pay without a vaccine, but a fifth are
              willing to pay nothing without one.  I find that partial
              refunds raise profit and total welfare relative to
              resale by 3.6% and 1.3%, but resale is better than not
              reallocating, improving profit by 1.8% and consumer
              welfare by 10.1%.  When there is uncertainty from
              covid-19, state-dependent refund contracts substantially
              increase profit and welfare relative to not
              reallocating, boosting profit and total welfare by 10.3%
              and 7.7%.

            <u><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="papers/bundling_resale.pdf"><h4>Why Bundle When Consumers Can Resell?</h4></a></u>
            <p class="desc_p">
              <!-- <span class="italics">Abstract</span>: --> Why do
              sellers offer discounted bundles when some consumers practice
              arbitrage through resale?  I develop a model of monopoly bundling
              with costly resale to explain the coexistence of price
              discrimination and resale and illustrate the effects of resale on
              bundling.  Larger bundle discounts can raise more revenue from
              consumers who do not resell, but also increase the number of less
              profitable resellers.  In equilibrium, it can be optimal to allow
              resale among some consumers to increase profit earned from the rest.
              The ability to resell reduces the returns to bundling and has an
              ambiguous effect on consumer and total welfare.
