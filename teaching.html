      <h6 style="color:black">Objectives</h6>

      <p>
        What skills make an economist?  We don't passively accept
        models and memorize results&mdash;we build models, scrutinize
        their assumptions, and evaluate them analytically and
        empirically.  My objective is for students to learn to do the
        same.
      </p>


      <h6 style="color:black">Methods</h6>

      <p>
        What methods help students master the economist's toolkit?  I
        relied on five when teaching intermediate microeconomics.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li> Clear explanations in lecture
          <p>
            Clarity is my first priority when planning lectures.
            Several course evaluations for intermediate micro mention
            clear lectures.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li> In-class practice
          <p>
            I often replace lectured examples with in-class exercises.
            The exercises help students learn by giving them a chance
            to practice new ideas and work through any confusion.
            Students work on their own for a few minutes before their
            solutions in small groups.  I monitor the groups and
            answer questions throughout.
          </p>
        </li>


        <li> Questions with twists
          <p>
            For students to master economic reasoning, they must
            practice it.  On problem sets and exams, questions should
            not only ask if students understand key models, but also
            ask them to critique the models and apply them in new
            ways.  For instance,
            in <a href="embedded_docs/final_sii18_solutions.pdf">question
            5 of the final</a> asks students to apply the principles
            of decision making under risk&mdash;studied in insurance
            markets&mdash;to a different, but economically equivalent
            setting.  The goal is to push students away from
            memorization and towards economic reasoning.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li> Emphasis on modeling principles
          <p>
            As with problem sets, lectures should explicitly emphasize
            the skills most important for students.  Rather than just
            present results for a series of models, the lecturer
            should show how the models share a common structure, how
            the same methods of analysis apply to each model, and how
            the resulting equations have an economic interpretation.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li> User-friendly background material
          <p>
            Intermediate micro relies heavily on calculus, but
            economics courses should be accessible for less prepared
            and less technical students.  To help them, I wrote
            a <a href="embedded_docs/math_notation_techniques.pdf">primer</a>
            covering all of the math needed for the course with
            step-by-step explanations.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>



      <h6 style="color:black">Assessing Students</h6>

      <ul>
        <li> In-class practice and discussions let me talk with
          students to learn what is most difficult.  If everyone is
          confused by the same thing, I can address it immediately.</li>

        <li>Problem sets and exams show when students repeat similar
          mistakes, which I can address in lecture and
          discussion.</li>
      </ul>



      <h6 style="color:black">Improvement</h6>

      <ul>
        <li>Professional development: I am enrolled in Duke's
          Certificate in College Teaching, which includes coursework
          and observation.</li>

        <li>Mid-term course evaluations: I used a mid-term survey to
          listen to student opinions and adjust my micro course.  I
          plan to ask again during my next courses.</li>

        <li>Revising course materials: I followed a traditional
          structure for my micro class, but plan to tweak it to
          emphasize types of analysis, like Nash equilibrium, that are
          critical in economics but not required for the major.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="color:#204a79;">Experience</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Instructor, ECON 205D (Intermediate Microeconomics with Calculus), 2018
          <p>
            Ran lecture and discussion, assigned problem sets, wrote
            and graded exams, and held office hours.  13 students
            (mainly economics majors).
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>Teaching Assistant, ECON 701/705 (PhD Microeconomics), 2016 -- 2017

          <p>Ran weekly discussion sections and office hours, graded
            problem sets and exams, edited lecture notes, wrote exam
            questions, and gave feedback on draft exams.  Coordinated
            with instructor each week about course schedule, problem
            sets, and questions on material.  Coordinated with another
            TA weekly about discussion section content and grading.
            Both courses had 25 economics PhD students.  701 had 25
            and 705 had 10 master's students and PhD students from
            other departments.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>Teaching Assistant, Regression Analysis (as an undergraduate), 2012

          <p>
            Ran office hours and graded problem sets with one other
            TA.  Met with faculty weekly to discuss problem sets and
            solutions.  Course had about 60 students, mainly economics
            majors.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>Peer Tutor/Head Math Tutor (as an undergraduate), 2010 -- 2013

          <p>Ran office hours for calculus I/II and intermediate
            macro, tutored one-on-one for anything and everything
            (most frequently intermediate macro and multivariable
            calculus).  Organized the calculus tutoring schedule as
            head math tutor from Fall 2012 to Spring 2013.

      <h3 style="color:#204a79;">Possible Courses</h3>

      <p>My expertise is in industrial organization and microeconomic
        theory.  I would be able to teach</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Industrial organization (graduate and undergraduate)</li>

        <li>Intermediate microeconomics (undergraduate)</li>

        <li>Game theory (undergraduate)</li>

        <li>Econometrics and statistics (undergraduate)</li>

        <li>Economic principles (undergraduate)</li>
      </ul>

      </ul>

      The evaluations have given me pointers for how to improve.  For
      example, problem sets hardly mattered to students' grades in
      205, and some students thought this was unfair after the time
      they spent on them.  Going forward, I plan to have problem sets
      count towards students' grades.
