      <br>

      <h6 style="color:#204a79">Objectives</h6>


      <p>What skills make an economist?  We build and tweak models,
        scrutinize their assumptions, and evaluate them analytically and
        empirically.  My objective is for students to learn to do the same.
      </p>


      <h6 style="color:#204a79">Methods</h6>

      <p>But how?  When I taught intermediate micro with calculus in
        Summer 2018, I relied on four strategies.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>In-class practice problems
          <p>To let students work out the kinks with new ideas, I
            asked them to solve example problems in class instead of
            lecturing the solution.  Students worked on their own
            before discussing them in groups of four; I answered
            questions throughout.  Students got hands-on practice that
            re-engaged them after lecture.  I saw firsthand what
            students found confusing and had a chance to help weaker
            students.  I used the same strategy in discussion sessions
            with more challenging problems.</p>
        </li>


        <li>User-friendly background material
              <p>Intermediate micro relies heavily on calculus, but
                economics courses should be accessible for less
                prepared and less technical students.  To help them, I
                wrote
                a <a href="embedded_docs/math_notation_techniques.pdf">primer</a>
                covering all of the math needed for the course with
                step-by-step explanations.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Emphasis on principles of modeling
              <p>My core objective is for students to learn the
                economist's toolkit.  To develop those tools, I
                emphasize that the structure of familiar models and
                the strategies used to analyze them apply elsewhere.
                For example, students can memorize how to derive
                ordinary demand in the consumer demand model, but it
                is more important that they recognize the underlying
                principles: the agent optimizes his objective subject
                to exogenous constraints.  I ask students to use the
                principles in new settings on assignments and exams.
                For instance,
                in <a href="embedded_docs/final_sii18_solutions.pdf">question
                5 of the final</a>, students must apply the principles
                of decision making under risk&mdash;studied in insurance
                markets&mdash;to a different, but economically equivalent
                setting.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Clear explanations
              <p>I have worked on making my explanations as clear as
                possible since my time in high school debate.  My
                approach is to distill the intuition to a few
                sentences and make it the centerpiece of my
                presentation, as in the ``Intuition'' section of my
                notes explaining
                the <a href="embedded_docs/cho_kreps_discussion.pdf">Cho-Kreps
                intuitive criterion</a> for PhD micro.  Several course
                evaluations[LINK] mention clear lectures.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>



      <h6 style="color:#204a79">Assessing Students</h6>

      <ul>
        <li> In-class practice and discussions let me talk with
          students to learn what is most difficult.  If everyone is
          confused by the same thing, I can address it immediately.</li>

        <li>Problem sets and exams show when students repeat similar
          mistakes, which I can address in lecture and
          discussion.</li>
      </ul>



      <h6 style="color:#204a79">Improvement</h6>

      <ul>
        <li>Professional development: I am enrolled in Duke's
          Certificate in College Teaching, which includes coursework
          and observation.</li>

        <li>Mid-term course evaluations: I used a mid-term survey to
          listen to student opinions and adjust my micro course.  I
          plan to ask again during my next courses.</li>

        <li>Revising course materials: I followed a traditional
          structure for my micro class, but I would like to tweak it
          to emphasize types of analysis, like Nash equilibrium, that
          are critical in economics but not required for the
          major.</li>
      </ul>

            and questions on material, and weekly with another TA
            about discussion section content and grading.  Course had
            about 25 economics PhD students and 10 (705) to 25 (701)
            master's students and PhD students from other departments.

          <p>
            Ran office hours and graded problem sets with one other
            TA.  Met with faculty weekly to discuss problem sets and
            solutions.  Course had about 60 students, mainly economics
            majors.
